# Predict_customer_churn

This project is part of **Udacity Machine Learning DevOps Engineer** course.\

This project takes a simple Jupiter Notebook implementation of a customer churn predidtion model, using simple linear regression.\
The focus is however, on using clean code practices, including PEP8 standards, and refactoring code to make it production ready and ready to use in a pipeline.
